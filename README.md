### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex and I am doing some stuff with computers, like everybody else who is active on this platform. Currently, I study Computer Science in Magdeburg (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany).

Currently, I work as a DevOps Engineer at [@UniNow](https://github.com/UniNow).

I also offer a site that provides some (at least for me) useful tools. You can find it [here](https://tools.alexbabel.com).
