### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex and I am doing some stuff with computers, like everybody else who is active on this platform. Currently, I study Computer Science in Magdeburg (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany).

* GraphQL
* Apollo Server & Client
* Express / Koa
* Java (in the past - I worked mostly with the Spigot & BungeeCord API \[Server framework for Minecraft\])
* Python (a bit for a lecture one semester ago)
* Bash (a bit)

#### ðŸ—ƒ Database Systems I use:
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL

#### ðŸ“¦ DevOps/Deployment technologies I use:
* Docker
* Kubernetes (GitOps approach with ArgoCD)
* Dokku
* Semantic Release

#### ðŸ›  Development Tools I use:
