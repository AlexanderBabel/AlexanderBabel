### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, and I am doing some stuff with computers, like everybody else who is active on this platform. Currently, I am a Masters student for Computer Science in Uppsala (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª Sweden).

Besides that, I work as a Platform Engineer at [@UniNow](https://github.com/UniNow). My day-to-day business includes doing fancy deployments in Kubernetes with ArgoCD and other tools. But sometimes I am also coding new features for the backend or frontend software running at the company.

I also offer a site that provides some (at least for me) useful tools. You can find it at [tools.alexbabel.com](https://tools.alexbabel.com).
